## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Settings sections

The Settings window SHALL present a sidebar with the groups "General", "Engines & Repos", and "System" and the pages "General & Startup", "Hotkeys & Quick Launcher", "Projects", "Project Discovery", "CLI Agents", "Terminal Profiles", "Appearance", "Logs", and "Updates". Selecting a page SHALL show that page's content and mark it active, and the window SHALL open on "General & Startup". Each existing preference SHALL appear on its page: the startup toggles on "General & Startup", the global hotkey on "Hotkeys & Quick Launcher", the default runtime on "Terminal Profiles", the agent detection fields on "CLI Agents", the path display style on "Appearance", and the startup update check and manual update check on "Updates". The "Projects" page SHALL be grouped with "Project Discovery" under "Engines & Repos" and SHALL present the registered project list with its management actions. A page whose settings are not yet implemented SHALL show a neutral empty state instead of controls. The footer SHALL show the current application version.

#### Scenario: Sections shown

- **WHEN** the Settings window opens
- **THEN** the sidebar shows the "General", "Engines & Repos", and "System" groups and the nine pages
- **AND** "General & Startup" is active and its content is shown

#### Scenario: Switch page

- **WHEN** the user selects another page in the sidebar
- **THEN** that page's content is shown and its sidebar item is marked active

#### Scenario: Projects page in the sidebar

- **WHEN** the Settings window opens
- **THEN** "Projects" appears under "Engines & Repos" next to "Project Discovery"
- **AND** selecting it shows the registered project list and its management actions

#### Scenario: Existing controls on their pages

- **WHEN** the Settings window opens
- **THEN** the "Start with Windows" and "Start minimized to tray" toggles appear on "General & Startup", the global-hotkey capture field on "Hotkeys & Quick Launcher", the default-runtime selector on "Terminal Profiles", the agent detection `Cache TTL, minutes` and `Version check timeout, seconds` fields on "CLI Agents", the path display selector on "Appearance", and the "Check for updates on startup" toggle and manual update check on "Updates"

#### Scenario: Current values loaded

- **WHEN** the Settings window opens
- **THEN** each control shows the value currently stored in configuration (and, for "Start with Windows", the current Windows registration state)

#### Scenario: Page without implemented settings

- **WHEN** the user opens a page that has no implemented settings yet
- **THEN** the page shows a neutral empty state instead of controls

#### Scenario: Version shown

- **WHEN** the Settings window opens
- **THEN** the footer shows the current application version

### Requirement: Save applies preferences

Saving SHALL validate a typed settings draft, apply all required system preferences, persist the draft only after required application succeeds, and close the window only after persistence succeeds. If any required application or persistence step fails, the stored preferences SHALL remain unchanged and the user SHALL receive an error without the window closing. Any system changes made before a failure SHALL be rolled back to their previous values where the platform boundary supports rollback.

#### Scenario: Persist on save

- **WHEN** the user changes one or more settings and chooses "Save" with a valid draft
- **THEN** all required system preferences are applied
- **AND** the values are written to `config.json`
- **AND** the window closes

#### Scenario: Runtime applied

- **WHEN** the user saves a different default runtime
- **THEN** subsequent agent launches use the newly selected runtime

#### Scenario: Hotkey applied immediately

- **WHEN** the user saves a different global hotkey
- **THEN** the previous hotkey is unregistered and the new one is registered without restarting the application

#### Scenario: Startup update check applied

- **WHEN** the user disables "Check for updates on startup" and saves
- **THEN** subsequent application starts do not perform the automatic update check

#### Scenario: Autostart applied

- **WHEN** the user toggles "Start with Windows" and saves
- **THEN** the per-user Run registration is created or removed to match the toggle

#### Scenario: Startup window visibility applied

- **WHEN** the user changes "Start minimized to tray" and saves
- **THEN** the next application start shows the launch window when the toggle is off and starts in the system tray when it is on

#### Scenario: Invalid draft does not save

- **WHEN** the user chooses "Save" with an invalid hotkey or invalid non-positive detection value
- **THEN** validation reports an error
- **AND** no system preference is applied
- **AND** no value is written to `config.json`
- **AND** the window remains open

#### Scenario: System application failure rolls back

- **WHEN** a required system preference cannot be applied while saving a valid draft
- **THEN** previously applied system changes are rolled back where supported
- **AND** the stored preferences remain unchanged
- **AND** the window remains open with an error

### Requirement: Agents probe fields

The agent detection fields SHALL accept blank values meaning "use defaults" and SHALL reject invalid numbers.

#### Scenario: Blank uses defaults
- **WHEN** either detection field is left empty and saved
- **THEN** the default for that field is used

#### Scenario: Invalid number rejected
- **WHEN** a detection field contains a non-numeric or non-positive value
- **THEN** the value is rejected and an error is shown and the window does not save

### Requirement: CLI Agents page management

The CLI Agents page SHALL present one card per loaded agent, the page-header summary cards defined by the `settings-theme` capability, and a "Default agent" selector, in addition to the existing agent detection fields. It SHALL show the stored default agent when opened. The "Default agent" selector SHALL offer every loaded agent plus a "None" option, SHALL mark agents that are not installed on the host as disabled entries that cannot be selected, and SHALL refresh the option availability when agent detection runs. The page SHALL offer an agent detection action labelled "Detect" above the agent cards that re-detects every supported agent's installed state and version, and refreshes the agent cards, the availability summary, and the option availability.

#### Scenario: Options offered

- **WHEN** the Settings window opens on "CLI Agents"
- **THEN** it shows the agent cards, the summary cards with the supported and installed counts, the "Default agent" selector, and the agent detection fields

#### Scenario: One card per agent

- **WHEN** the plugin catalog contains agents
- **THEN** the page shows one card for each loaded agent

#### Scenario: Metrics shown

- **WHEN** the page opens
- **THEN** the supported count is the number of loaded agents and the installed count is the number installed on the host

#### Scenario: Stored default agent loaded

- **WHEN** a default agent has been saved
- **THEN** the "Default agent" selector shows it selected

#### Scenario: No stored default agent

- **WHEN** no default agent preference has been stored
- **THEN** the selector offers a "None" option and no agent is selected by default

#### Scenario: Uninstalled agents are not selectable

- **WHEN** the "Default agent" dropdown is opened
- **THEN** agents that are not installed on the host are shown dimmed and disabled
- **AND** they cannot be selected, while "None" and installed agents remain selectable

#### Scenario: Detection refreshes option availability

- **WHEN** an agent detection pass completes while the page is open, whether from a single-agent test or the detect action above the agent cards
- **THEN** the option availability reflects the fresh installed states without reopening the window

#### Scenario: Detect action re-probes every supported agent

- **WHEN** the user invokes the detect action above the agent cards
- **THEN** the installed state and version of every supported agent are re-detected against the host
- **AND** the agent cards, the availability summary, and the option availability refresh without reopening the window
- **AND** the action is unavailable while a detection pass is already running

#### Scenario: Detect action label

- **WHEN** the CLI Agents page is shown
- **THEN** the detection action above the agent cards is labelled "Detect"
